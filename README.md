## Setting up Environment
To use the `confidenceset` toolbox, run the following command directly to install the library.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/username/repository_name.git
```
Alternatively, You can set up the environment by installing the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The list of dependencies can be found in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/HowonRyu/ConfidenceSet/blob/main/requirements.txt) file.



## Demonstration
For simulation demonstration for signals is presented in [ConfidenceRegion_Demonstration.ipynb](https://github.com/HowonRyu/ConfidenceSet/blob/main/ConfidenceRegion_Demonstration.ipynb)
